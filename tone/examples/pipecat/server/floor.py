"""The floor: whose voice plays when, in the room worker's pipeline.

    … → Router → CastBridge → FloorGate → transport.output() → FloorEar

Every character has their own TTS and their own transport destination (an audio track of their
own), so their voices can overlap. The floor decides when each line may play:

- `CastBridge` takes the characters' voices off the bus (their TTS frames, each stamped with the
  take, the line it belongs to). Nothing in the room crosses back: characters get lines as jobs.
- `FloorGate` holds each line until its turn. A line is *expected* (`Floor.expect`) with the
  lines it must wait for: a reply waits for the line it answers, plus a beat; a chorus waits for
  nothing, its voices staggered a little; a reaction waits for the line it reacts to and comes in
  as it ends. Held frames are released together, their word timings moved along by however long
  they were held. When the user cuts in, the gate drops every held line and interrupts every
  destination (an interruption only clears the destination it names), so all the voices stop.
  The output transport says when each destination starts and stops speaking; the gate passes on
  one "bot speaking" for the room (from the first voice starting to the last one stopping), so
  the user's turn-taking and idle timer see the table as one speaker.
- `FloorEar`, after the output, keeps the words actually heard of each line, so a line cut short
  is recorded as far as it was heard.

The floor reports to its listener (the director) as each line starts, finishes (or is cut short),
or is dropped unheard, and whenever the set of voices playing changes.
