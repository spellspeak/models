"""The four: their prompts, and `CharacterWorker`, the worker that speaks as one.

Each character is a worker of its own, with its own LLM and its own TTS (its voice, sent to its
own transport destination, so it plays on its own audio track in the room):

    bridge in → LLM → Script → TTS → Stamp → bridge out

A line arrives as a `speak` job from the room: the character's view of the whole conversation,
and a take id. The worker writes the line (sending it back as a job update as soon as it's
written, so the room can plan what follows while it's still being voiced), voices it, and
answers the job once the TTS is done. Every frame it sends carries the take id, so the room can
hold a line until its turn and drop anything from a line it has abandoned. Cancelling the job
interrupts the worker.

Characters take no frames from the bus: with several of them active at once, each would echo
the others' frames back onto it. Their lines come as jobs, and they only ever send.
