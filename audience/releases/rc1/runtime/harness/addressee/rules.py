"""The rules baseline: word matching plus the rules of evidence (harness/addressee/evidence.py). No model.

It is the floor every model is compared against, the scene demo's first engine, and the harness's instant fallback.
What the words pick out is guessed from the text:

1. Names: a person's label or alias used to call them: at the start, after a greeting or "hey", or set off by commas
   ("Tomas, another round", "Oi, barkeep!"). A name the line only talks about ("tell Wren", "talking to the mechanic")
   is not a call. Two or more calls are a set named on purpose ("Tomas, Wren, a word").
1b. Neighbours: "you, talking to the barkeep" points at whoever's card says they are with the barkeep.
2. Group words with no name: "everyone", "anyone", "someone", "all of you", "you guys", "you lot", "listen up". "You
   two" and "both of you" are the two people present when there are two, otherwise the group (rule 2).
3. Descriptions: content words of each visible feature value found in the line ("red hat" in "you in the red hat").
   The person or people with the most matching words are picked out. A word matches a longer one it starts
   ("fire" and "fireplace") when it has four letters or more.

Then `evidence.resolve` applies the rules of evidence with the history and the spatial facts. Known limits: no fuzzy
match for misheard names, and any shared content word counts as a description, even an incidental one.
