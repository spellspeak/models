"""How the addressee model reads a request (render addressee-input-0.1). Shared by training and the runtime.

Everyone present comes first, one bracketed marker each holding what the player can see of them and, when the game
knows, where they are. Then the player's line. Then the history, newest first, so truncation cuts the oldest line
and never a person or the line itself:

    People: [Tomas (the barkeep). role: barkeep; headwear: red hat; holding: a tankard. near you, in view, spoke with
    you last] [Wren. role: mercenary; hair: hidden. mid-range, out of view]. The player: "You in the red hat, a word."
    Before: Tomas to the player: "Another round?" | The player to Tomas: "Go on then."

A person's head reads the tokens of their marker, brackets included. Features keep the caller's order; a card over
`MAX_CARD_CHARS` loses features from the end, so put the most telling features first.
Spatial facts are never cut. Unknown facts are left out; known negatives that matter are said ("out of view").
